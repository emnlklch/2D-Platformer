# 2D-Platformer
Blood, sweat and tears have gone into this. First tears of frustration and dispair, then tears of joy when it finally ran. It's also really hot in here. Oh, and I got a paper cut...

1200+ lines of code and more time than I would like to admit later, here's a prototype game with neccessary functionality of a 2D platformer built in (including some extra goodies to make your life easier). Use this code as you please, but if you like it, give it a star!
